## Real-time epidemic modelling of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater data

Datasets:
1. Aggregated dataset of wastewater measurements (https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python) from Morvan M et al.
2. Incidence data - new cases by specimen date (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases) from UKHSA
3. Reproduction number - upper bound and lower bound (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-r-value-and-growth-rate) from UKHSA

Code for:
1. Data wrangling and linkage
2. Modified [Compartmental Model](https://github.com/scwatson812/COVID19WastewaterModel) from CS McMahan et al.
3. Modified [Deconvolution Model](https://github.com/JSHuisman/wastewaterRe) from Huisman JS et al.
4. Modified [Boosting Method](https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python) from Morvan M et al.
