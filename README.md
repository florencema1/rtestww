## Real-time epidemic modelling of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater data

Datasets:
1. Aggregated dataset of wastewater measurements from Morvan et al.(https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python) 
2. Incidence data - new cases by specimen date from UKHSA (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases) 
3. Reproduction number - upper bound and lower bound from UKHSA (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-r-value-and-growth-rate) 

Code for:
1. Data wrangling and linkage
2. Modified [Compartmental Model] from McMahan et al. (https://github.com/scwatson812/COVID19WastewaterModel) 
3. Modified [Deconvolution Model] from Huisman et al. (https://github.com/JSHuisman/wastewaterRe) 
4. Modified [Boosting Method] from Morvan et al. (https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python)
