## Real-time epidemic modelling of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater data

1) Datasets:
- Aggregated dataset of wastewater measurements from Morvan et al.(https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python) 
- Incidence data - new cases by specimen date from UKHSA (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases) 
- Reproduction number - upper bound and lower bound from UKHSA (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-r-value-and-growth-rate) 


2) Code for:
- Data wrangling and linkage
- Modified [Compartmental Model](https://github.com/scwatson812/COVID19WastewaterModel) from McMahan et al. 
- Modified [Deconvolution Model](https://github.com/JSHuisman/wastewaterRe) from Huisman et al. 
- Modified [Boosting Method](https://github.com/kath-o-reilly/wbe_prevalence_england_python) from Morvan et al. 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analysis using modified models

3) Static visualisations
